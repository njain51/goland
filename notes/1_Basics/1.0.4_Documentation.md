# Documentation

- Documenting your code 


### README

- its usually in plain text/markdown
- serves as an introduction to a project explaining what it does and why.
- common used sections:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - FAQ
  - Support
  - Contributing
  - Contact information
  - License
  - Acknowledgment

### Wiki

- website that can be edited by multiple users
- example: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki
- confluence

### Release notes/changelogs

- specific types of documentation used for informing and keeping track of updates, so it's particularly useful for version control. 

### Autogenerated code

- their work is mostly based on the comments embedded in the source code in the first place, they simply convert what's already been written into a more structured and readable form
- example:
  - https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html
  - https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
  - https://www.drexplain.com/

## Pros and cons

**Pros**:
- helps to refresh your memory
- guides you through the code
- explains how the code works and how to use it
- helps to fix bugs
- allows for version control


**Cons**:
- takes a lot of time
- takes practice to make it structured and clear
- easily becomes outdated, so needs to be updated all the time
- it's a common practice to write documentation in English which might be a foreign language for you
- constant feedback is needed to make it genuinely good
